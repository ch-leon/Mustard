# ADR-0003 — Agent runs via the `claude` CLI subscription, not the API

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-12)

## Context
For personal use Leon wants to use his **Claude Code subscription**, not pay
per-token via the Anthropic API. Claude Code supports headless invocation
(`claude -p "…" --output-format json`) that draws on the logged-in subscription.

## Decision
The agent **shells out to the `claude` CLI in headless print mode** with no API
key. `ClaudeRunner.run` spawns a `Process`; `AgentService` runs invocations
**serially** and backs off on rate-limit signals.

Two implementation details are load-bearing and were proven by real failures:
1. **Scrub the environment** — drop all `ANTHROPIC_*` and `CLAUDE*` vars before
   spawning, so a worker launched from inside a Claude Code session (which injects
   a proxy `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) still authenticates against the CLI's own login.
2. **Close stdin** (`/dev/null`) — otherwise the CLI blocks waiting on the pipe.
3. `MUSTARD_CLAUDE_BIN` overrides the binary (tests use a stub script).

## Consequences
- No metered billing; uses subscription quota.
- The agent is **anchored to this Mac** (the machine with the logged-in CLI) and
  cannot move to a cloud server without re-introducing API billing. iOS never runs
  the agent — it observes the synced store.
- Tokens expire: a background sweep can 401 silently. Use `claude setup-token` for
  a long-lived headless token; `/login` refreshes an expired interactive one.
- The live subscription path can't be verified from the dev session (nested-session
  keychain limits) — verified from Leon's own terminal.
